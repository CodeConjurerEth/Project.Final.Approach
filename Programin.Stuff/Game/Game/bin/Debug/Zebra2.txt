Zebra, the racially confused horse. 
    In addition to keeping zebras cool, it’s thought that a zebra’s stripes also serve to help camouflage the 
    animal in long grass, and distract predators. While that might seem unlikely when we look at them, you’ve 
    got to remember that lions are colour blind, and a herd of stripy running zebras will be confusing if you 
    see everything in black and white.
    A group of zebras is called a dazzle, you can also call it a herd or a zeal but that makes you boring.
