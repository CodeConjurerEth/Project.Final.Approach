White-backed vulture, the discount condor.
    They live in most open fields and like to hang around in scattered trees, but you will find them all
    throughout places that you can find other animals, since they are scavengers.
    Their diet is simple, see dead animal, eat dead animal, there are no picky members in this species.
    They like to swoop in with a large number of other vultures so nobody else can eat their food.
    Unsurprisingly they are a vital role to the ecosystem, them being the literal cleaners and disease
    preventers. Since all the corpses of the animals can become breeding grounds for bacteria and diseases 
    that are bad.
    They are the most widespread and common vulture in all of Africa.
