African Elephant, the Overcompensating Mammal.	
    one to two octaves lower than the human hearing limit. As lower frequency sounds travel farther than
    their higher counterparts, their range of communication is extensive.
    Communication is vital to elephants, who rely on a social network for survival. The sustaining social 
    unit is a herd of mothers and their young, sisters, and female cousins, led by an older matriarch. 
    Male elephants will leave the herd at around 14 years old when they hit puberty.
