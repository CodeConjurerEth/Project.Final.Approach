Saddle-billed stork, the literate bird.
    Only because it has saddle in its name doesn’t mean that you can ride it.
    The Saddle-billed stork lives at the continental scale, preferring protected areas that have a higher
    extent of open water in comparison to the rest of Africa.
    Their diet consists of mainly fish, but they can also eat frogs, crabs, small birds and reptiles.
    The bird actually represents an Ancient Egyptian hieroglyph (Gardiner G29) that had the phonetic 
    value of “b ꜣ”.
