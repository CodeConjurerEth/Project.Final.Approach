Hippopotamus, the land whale mammal.
    Hippos are very rotund animals and are the third largest living land mammals, after elephants and 
    white rhinos. They grow to between 10.8 and 16.5 feet (3.3 to 5 meters) long and up to 5.2 feet (1.6 m) tall
    at the shoulder. The average female weighs around 3,000 lbs. (1,400 kilograms), while males weigh 
    3,500 to 9,920 lbs. (1,600 to 4,500 kg).
    Hippos live in sub-Saharan Africa. They live in areas with abundant water, as they spend most of their time 
    submerged to keep their skin cool and moist. Considered amphibious animals, hippos spend up to 16 hours
    per day in the water.
    Hippos are very loud animals. Their snorts, grumbles and wheezes have been measured at 115 decibels,
