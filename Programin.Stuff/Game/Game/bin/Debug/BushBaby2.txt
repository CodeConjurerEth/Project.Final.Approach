Bushbaby, the terrified squirrel-cat.	
    are solitary. When disturbed in the daytime, they may be very slow, but at night these animals are active 
    and agile, and can jump 3 to 5 meters in one go. On level surfaces, a bush baby hops like a miniature 
    kangaroo, but they usually travel by climbing and jumping through the trees. They moisten their feet and 
    hands with urine, which is thought to assist in holding onto branches and may function as scent marking as 
    well. They have a high-pitched, chirping call which is made most often during mornings and evenings. 
    Tactile communication, during play, grooming and aggression, is important for these animals, especially 
    between mothers and their offspring and between mates.
