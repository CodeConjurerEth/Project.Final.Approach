African Wild Dogs, the painted wolves.
    though significant damage is rare and most dogs prefer wild prey.
    People have attempted to tame painted wolves, but never successfully. They are naturally distrusting of 
    humans or indeed any animal outside of their own pack. When humans have domesticated dogs in the past, 
    it was due to certain character traits prevalent in canines that could be amplified through breeding. 
    One of these traits was a willingness to be touched by humans. This, combined with traits of curiosity 
    and opportunism, paved the way for humanity’s greatest symbiotic relationship with an animal affectionately 
    named “man’s best friend.” Painted wolves have never displayed these traits and it is unlikely they 
    ever will.
