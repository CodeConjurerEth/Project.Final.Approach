Gazelle, the exotic Antelope.
    grueling environments, gazelles shrink their heart and liver. Breathing can cause an animal to lose a 
    lot of water. A smaller heart and liver need less oxygen, so the animal can breathe less and lose less water.
    These animals are highly social. Some gazelle herds have as many as 700 members, though some herds are 
    small and segregated by gender. Female Thomson's gazelles, for example, live in herds of 10 to 30 females 
    in addition to their young. Males live alone or in small groups with other males. A male herd is called a 
    bachelor's herd. The segregation of herds is more prominent during mating season.
    The name gazelle comes from the Arabic "gazal," the term for love poems.
