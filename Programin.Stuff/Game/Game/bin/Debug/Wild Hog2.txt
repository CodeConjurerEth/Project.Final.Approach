Wild boar, where is Timon?
    sounder after only 8 to 15 months! While the female piglets will stay with their mothers. If a mother dies 
    prematurely, her piglets will be adopted by a different female in the sounder.
    The males life can be rough, during mating period there is so much competition around the females, that at
    the end they are so badly hurt that they might have lost 20% (!) of their body weight. With penile injuries 
    not being uncommon at all.
