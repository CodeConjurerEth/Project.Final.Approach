    head butt the others body. Males with longer and stronger necks tend to win these fights, and often get 
    the female. It is thought therefore, that longer necks may also help when attracting females.
    Giraffes have one of the shortest sleep requirements of any mammal, and will only sleep for around four 
    hours a day. They sleep either laying down with their necks resting on their bodies, or standing up. 
    Sleep occurs in short intervals, sometimes less than a minute.
    Giraffes are browsers, so use their long neck to feed on the leaves, shoots, and fruits of tall bushes and 
    trees. They feed on a variety of plants and diet varies depending on location and season, 
    but acacia leaves and shoots are most common.
