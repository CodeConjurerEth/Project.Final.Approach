Zebra, the racially confused horse. 
    Zebras groom one another, if you see a zebra biting one of its kind don’t kink shame it, join them. 
    For them it’s like scratching an itch.
    Zebras are widespread across vast areas of southern and eastern Africa, where they live in their preferred 
    habitat of treeless grasslands and savannah woodlands. However, their habitat is shrinking, and they’re 
    already extinct in two of the countries to which they’re native.
    Zebras make a range of noises, some of which are the same as horses while others are unique. Like horses, 
    zebras will snort when excited and nicker (creating a ‘whuffle’ kind of sound by blowing air through their 
    nose and lips) when greeting each other.
