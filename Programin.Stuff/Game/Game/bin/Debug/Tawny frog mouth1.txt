Tawny frog mouth, the AAAAAAH bird.
    They live all over savannas across Africa. Anywhere they can build a nest and find food.
    Their diet consists of beetles, centipedes, scorpions, caterpillars and occasionally mice.
    They watch quietly from a stump or a branch until it decides to pounce on its prey. Maybe imitating 
    the larger felines.
    They are mainly active at night, their coat making them near invisible in the dark.
    Frogmouths like the name implies have large frog-like mouths. If a frogmouth is disturbed,
    it may adopt a threatening pose, fluffing out its feathers, showing its wide orange eyes and opening 
    its beak in a wide froglike gape to reveal its yellow throat, hoping to appear intimidating.
