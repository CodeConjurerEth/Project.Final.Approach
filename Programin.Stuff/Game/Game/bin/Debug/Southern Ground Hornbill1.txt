Southern ground hornbil, the toucan-rooster African Style.
    They live all throughout the southern part of Africa, roosting in trees and building nests for their young.
    They usually walk in groups looking for food which differs from fruits and seeds to insects, toads, lizards,
    snakes, tortoises. They also pray on mammals such as hares, rates, squirrels and sometimes even small
    monkeys.
    The southern ground hornbill likes to live in groups, ranging from two to nine with only one dominant male
    and female in the group breed. There are only one to three eggs at a time whereas only one of them survives.
	The other members of the group defend the territory and care for the chiks.
    They can live up to 70 years in captivity.
