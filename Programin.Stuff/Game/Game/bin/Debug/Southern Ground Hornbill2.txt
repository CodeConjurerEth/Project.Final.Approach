Southern ground hornbil, the toucan-rooster African Style.
    A group of southern ground hornbills is called a flock.
    They can fly up to 30km/hour.
    This vocal bird uses its wattle to make booming calls that are so loud theyâ€™re often mistaken for a 
    lion roar. The wattle is that coloured flesh on their throat. The males have a orange-red-ish wattle
    whereas the females have a blue one.
