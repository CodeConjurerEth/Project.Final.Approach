Nile Crocodile, and they say rhymes aren’t funny.
    They live in the sub-Saharan Africa, usually by the Nile Basin (hence the name), they flop around 
    the Madagascar rivers but they’re no strangers to freshwater marshes and mangrove swamps.
    They are mainly carnivores. Their diet consisting mostly of fish but they’ll attack anything including
    zebras, small hippos, porcupines, birds and even other crocodiles. It scavenges carrion’s. 
    They can eat up to half its own body weight at a feeding.
    Crocodiles live on both water and land, but the harsh sun of Africa makes them prefer the water.
    A group of crocodiles can have two names depending on where they’re situated. On land they’re called
    a Bask, meanwhile in the water they’re called a Float.
