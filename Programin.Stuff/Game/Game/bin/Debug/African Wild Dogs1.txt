African Wild Dogs, the painted wolves.
    Though they were once found throughout the continent—from desert to mountain habitats—African wild dogs have
    disappeared from most of their geographic range. These days, African wild dogs typically roam the open 
    plains and sparse woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. Their largest populations can be found in Botswana, 
    Zimbabwe, Namibia, Zambia, Tanzania, and Mozambique.
    African wild dogs hunt in formidable, cooperative packs of six to 20 (or more) animals. Larger packs were 
    more common before the dogs became endangered. Packs hunt antelopes and will also tackle much larger prey, 
    such as wildebeests, particularly if their quarry is ill or injured. The dogs supplement their diet with 
    rodents and birds. As human settlements expand, the dogs have sometimes developed a taste for livestock,
