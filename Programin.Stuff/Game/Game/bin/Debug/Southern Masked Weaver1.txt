Southern masked weaver, the banana bird.
    They live in a wider range of habitats, including shrub lands, savannas, grasslands, open woodlands,
    inland wetlands, and semi- desert areas. They also occur in suburban gardens and parks. 
    Their diet consists of insects and seeds, but they feed on the nectar of some plants and eat from
    man-made feeding tables.
    A southern masked weaver lives in nests forming various colonies.
    The bird isn’t that interesting but it’s unique colours are a sight to behold,
    it has been appreciated by many photographs.
