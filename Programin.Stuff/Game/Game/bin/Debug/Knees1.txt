Thick Knee ,the cat-fish bird
    Not living up to the expectations of many they actually have fairly skinny knees.
    They live in semi-desert areas, agricultural land, dry pasture and also well vegetated river valleys.
    Their diet consists of mainly small insects and animals but if they catch a lizard they won’t be picky.
    They dabble with corn and alfalfa.
    They don’t have a really knowns style of life besides cat-fishing students that research the thick-knee.
    They are most active at night and they’re really hard to spot because of its camouflaged, brownish feathers.
    Remember kids, a thick-knee is a cat-fish but thick-thighs save lives.
