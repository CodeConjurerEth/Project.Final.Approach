African Elephant, the Overcompensating Mammal.
    African elephants range throughout the savannas of sub-Saharan Africa and the rainforests of central and
    West Africa. The continent’s northernmost elephants are found in Sahel area of Mali. The smaller ones.
    Because elephants eat so much, they’re increasingly coming into contact with humans. An elephant can 
    destroy an entire season of crops in a single night—a huge blow to a farmer, who may want to retaliate. 
    There are a number of conservation programs working with farmers to help them protect their crops 
    (elephants are so smart that they can learn to get around electric fences quickly!) and provide 
    compensation when an elephant does raid them.
    A combination of the upper lip and nose, an African elephant’s trunk is extremely versatile.
