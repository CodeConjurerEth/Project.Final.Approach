African Elephant, the overcompensating mammal.
    African elephants range throughout the savannas of sub-Saharan Africa and the rainforests of central and West Africa.
    The continent’s northernmost elephants are found in Sahel area of Mali. The small.
    Because elephants eat so much, they’re increasingly coming into contact with humans. 
    An elephant can destroy an entire season of crops in a single night—a huge blow to a farmer, who may want
	to retaliate.
    There are a number of conservation programs working with farmers to help them protect their crops 
    (elephants are so smart that they can learn to get around electric fences quickly!) and provide compensation when an elephant does raid them.
    A combination of the upper lip and nose, an African elephant’s trunk is extremely versatile. Elephants use their trunk for smelling, breathing,
    detecting vibrations, caressing their young, sucking up water, and grasping objects. The tip of their trunk is comprised of two opposable extensions, or fingers, which allow for extreme dexterity.
    An African elephant’s large ears also serve many purposes. The ears’ large surface area helps radiate excess heat under the harsh African sun.
    The ears are also often used to communicate visually. Flapping their ears can signify either aggression or joy. 
    Although elephants can make a very wide range of sounds (10 octaves), they mostly communicate through low frequency sounds called “rumbling.”
    In fact, elephants are capable of producing and perceiving sounds one to two octaves lower than the human hearing limit. As lower frequency sounds travel farther than their higher counterparts, their range of communication is extensive.
    Communication is vital to elephants, who rely on a social network for survival. The sustaining social unit is a herd of mothers and their young,
    sisters, and female cousins, led by an older matriarch. Male elephants will leave the herd at around 14 years old when they hit puberty.
