Download SourceTree (you don't have to but it's much easier I think)
- Clone the online repository to your PC (if you're in SourceTree there's a clone button there)
- Make changes to the folder you cloned then follow the steps underneath
- Always commit first (only staged will be uploaded (this is on your local repository))
- Always pull before you push (pulling from the online repo to your local repo)
- When you push you merge your local repo with the online one

If you're confuzed just ask Vlad, he is slightly confuzed too but he fucked around with it a lot more (supposedly)

Readme is there because I can't upload folders otherwise apparently
